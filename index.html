        <h4>OUR STORY</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="text2">
        <p id="p">We’re Christopher and Shawn, the founders of DRIVER. What<br>
             makes us good friends and business partners is our passion for <br>
             people, creative solutions, sustainability, and electric vehicles.<br>
              One weekend, during a backpacking trip in the San Bernardino<br>
               National Forest, we discovered we could make a positive impact <br>
               on our planet even after we left the forest. Thus, DRIVER was <br>
               born. Through self-sustainable vehicles, we could prevent carbon <br>
               emissions from harming the environment. With one rental <br>
               company, our goal is to inspire the community and the world to <br>
               opt out of renting gas-powered vehicles and rent sustainable <br>all-electric cars instead.</p>
